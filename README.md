## What Is Dreamscape?
Dreamscape is a C# open source game engine built on top of MonoGame that allows you to not have to worry about low-level game specifics, so that you can just "sit down and code". It comes with it's own system of drawing, managing input, playing audio, cutscenes, collisions, and more!

## Can I Use Dreamscape For My Project?
Absolutely! You are free to use, modify, and share the code of Dreamscape as much as you desire. My only restriction is that if you plan on selling your game, that you make a deal with me first. The second you profit off of my work you are no longer using my work for creative use, but for profit, and in that case I feel that my hard work on the engine gets me at least a little slice of that pie.

## How Do I Learn How To Use Dreamscape?
For a full guide on everything, you will have to wait for the official release of the Dreamscape Engine. As much as I'd love to help you use the engine as soon as possible, I cannot make any guides until the engine is done. The internal framework is constantly changing. If you wake up the next day, how to draw a drawing could be entirely different! For now please the #help channel to ask individual questions, which I should answer relatively quickly.

## Why Should I Use Dreamscape?
While a lot of modern game engine are powerful, I feel that they lack the same freedom one has when they are just working with a framework. Using an engine forces you to conform to using its interface. But all I want at the end of the day is just an IDE and a lot of a features the big engines do, just within my own realm. Dreamscape bridges the gap between framework and engine, it does all the hard work for you. You get the freedom of using a framework, but with the benefits of a true game engine. It's a win-win!
